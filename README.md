# unit-4-game

I used a bootstrap platform for this game,

The game simulates a battle between Rebel ships and Empire ships.
Each ship has certain health and attack amounts.
I also pieced together code that allows a special skill to be used every other turn.

Unfortunately, i'm really struggling with layout.  After days of debugging, i still can't center things.  I know it's a layout/format/col/row issue.  But i can't seem to find it.

Will keep working on it.
